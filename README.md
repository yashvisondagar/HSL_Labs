# HSL Labs – Operations Dashboard

A modern, responsive healthcare operations dashboard built using **HTML, Tailwind CSS, and component‑based UI principles**. This project demonstrates real‑world lab workflows such as patient intake, disclosures, inventory, packaging, billing, and training management.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **HSL Labs Dashboard** is designed to help laboratory staff and administrators quickly monitor daily operations, track task statuses, and manage critical workflows across devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile).

The UI focuses on:

- Clarity and usability for healthcare staff
- Clean, professional visual design
- Responsive layouts for real‑world usage

---

## 🎯 Assignment Objectives Covered

This project fulfills the following evaluation criteria:

### ✅ Modern, clean, professional dashboard design

- Card‑based KPI layout
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Minimal, purposeful color usage

### ✅ Responsive UI (Desktop / Tablet / Mobile)

- Desktop: full data table and KPIs
- Tablet: adaptive grid and scrollable layouts
- Mobile: card views, bottom navigation, slide‑in menu

### ✅ Built using HTML + Tailwind CSS

- Tailwind utility classes used exclusively for styling
- No external UI frameworks (Bootstrap, MUI, etc.)

### ✅ Component‑based & Blade‑compatible structure

- Reusable UI components (KPI cards, navigation items, tables)
- Easily convertible to Laravel Blade partials

### ✅ Usability & accessibility considerations

- Clear labels and icons
- Status indicators with text + icons (not color‑only)
- Search, filtering, pagination, loading, and empty states

### ✅ Clear communication of design decisions

- Designed around real healthcare lab workflows
- Optimized for daily operational monitoring
